## ‚ú® Introduction
This project aims to analyze Malaysian health survey data from 2022 to understand the relationship between personal health attributes such as the BMI, physical activity, sleep patterns and existing medical conditions and the likelihood of heart disease. Through data driven analysis and predictive modeling, this project will offer a valuable insight that can support preventive heart disease strategies.

## üìå Objectives and Goals
‚Ä¢ To explore the patterns in the dataset and understand how various health factors are connected to heart disease.\
‚Ä¢ To develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on their health-related information.\
‚Ä¢ To analyze and compare the health trends from the year 2022 in order to observe any noticeable changes or patterns over time.
